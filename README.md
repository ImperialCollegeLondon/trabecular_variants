# Genetic and phenotypic analyses of cardiac trabeculation

Cardiac trabeculae form a network of muscular strands that line the inner surfaces of the heart, and their development involves molecular pathways that regulate structural complexity. Trabeculation is a complex and incompletely understood phenotype, and the contribution of common and rare genetic variation to its development has not been determined. We report genes with a burden of rare variants and novel common variant associations across the allele frequency spectrum for trabecular morphology in 47,803 participants of UK Biobank using fractal dimension analysis of cardiac imaging.
